Mama... Just killed a man
Put a gun agaist his head,
Pull the trigger now he's dead,
Mama... Life has just began,
But now I've gone and thrown it all away,
Mama, oooh,
Didn't mean to make you cry,
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
carry on,
carry on,
As if nothing really matters,

- Bohemian Rhapsody, Queen(Freddie Mercury)
